# GAN Review for Computer Vision
A Survey and Taxonomy of the Recent GANs Development. Please refer to the details in recent review paper [“Generative Adversarial Networks in Computer Vision: A Survey and Taxonomy” Zhengwei Wang and Qi She and Tomas E. Ward](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3439723) ([arxiv version](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01529.pdf)). We also provide a list of papers related to GANs on computer vision in the GAN_CV.csv file.

We have classified the two GAN-variants research lines based on recent GAN developments, below we provide a summary and the demo code of these models. We have tested the codes below and tried to summary some of <b>lightweight</b> and <b>easy-to-reuse</b> module of state-of-the-art GANs.
