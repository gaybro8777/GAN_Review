[2021/07/11] Our preprint ["Generative Adversarial Networks in Time Series: A Survey and Taxonomy", Eoin Brophy and Zhengwei Wang and Qi She and Tomas E. Ward](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11098.pdf) is out. This work is currently in progress.

[2021/02/14] Our paper [“Generative Adversarial Networks in Computer Vision: A Survey and Taxonomy” Zhengwei Wang and Qi She and Tomas E. Ward](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3439723) ([arxiv version](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01529.pdf)) has been published at **ACM Computing Surveys**，and we will continue to polish this work into the 5th version. Details of selected papers and codes can refer to [GAN_CV folder](https://github.com/sheqi/GAN_Review/tree/master/GAN_CV).

[2020/11/24] Our paper [“Generative Adversarial Networks in Computer Vision: A Survey and Taxonomy” Zhengwei Wang and Qi She and Tomas E. Ward](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01529.pdf) gets acceptted into **ACM Computing Surveys**，and we will continue to polish this work into the 5th version.

[2020/06/20] We have updated our **4th** version of GAN survey for **computer vision** paper ! It inlcudes more recent GANs proposed at CVPR, ICCV 2019/2020, more intuitive visualization of GAN Taxonomy.

[2020/10/04] GANs related to our latest paper will be updated shortly.
